# Instagram Api

This is my first test of angular.
After installation and execution you can authorize my app
to communicate with your instagram account.

__It will definately not send any private data to me or any others.__

It stores the access_token for api access in your local web storage.

After the authorisation process you see your latest images. Videos are
currently not supported! With the 'Load Next' Button you are able to Load
the next image in the current feed.

You can also enter a search value into the field on top of the site.
It will search for matching tags and users. Results are shown on availability
in a dropdown list expanding below the search bar.

You can click an image to make it bigger inside a modal.
